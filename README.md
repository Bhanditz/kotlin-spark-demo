# Kotlin / Spark Sample

A port of the [Java-based Spark demo][1] that was presented at the Java user group meeting in Stockholm in December 2014. 

This sample does not show how to use [Spark][3] (refer to the [Java version of the sample for that][1]). Instead, 
it shows how the [Kotlin programming language][2] can be used together with [Spark][3] to create a more real-world API.

For more information about this sample, refer to the Nordic APIs [blog post series about it](http://nordicapis.com/building-apis-on-the-jvm-using-kotlin-and-spark-part-1/).
